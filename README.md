- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ehtisham Ullah Baig, certified Google Ads Specialist and a Performance Marketer working currently at an international travel company in Pakistan.
- ðŸ‘€ My interests revolve around Data Science and Iâ€™m currently learning Python to apply statistical models on datasets for supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning. To plot the insights and make them more interactive I did a course on Power BI to make visuals more appealing. We had to do data cleaning sometimes and for that I use Python (Pandas and other libraries) and SQL to get rid of unnecessary data.
- ðŸŒ±I would love to connect with fellows around the world with similar interests in this domain and exchange valuable knowledge.
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me by sending an email to "eullahbaig@khi.iba.edu.pk".
